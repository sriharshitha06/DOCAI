Answer:\n\nFever is a sign that the body is fighting off infection, which can cause symptoms such as redness, pain, sweating, and fever. The fever should be at least 105°F (40.68°C) or higher to indicate an infection or illness. If you've had a fever over the previous two days, it may mean that you have a respiratory illness or viral infection. Infections such as common cold, influenza, or the flu may cause similar symptoms, but they do not typically produce fevers at such high temperatures. If you've experienced severe symptoms such as sweating profusely and shaking uncontrollably within a day of developing the fever, it could be a sign of sepsis or other serious illnesses. In either case, seeking medical attention is critical to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. If you have any concerns about your symptoms or are experiencing severe symptoms that persist after two days, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider.",

Papules (closed sacs) near the skin's surface are called \"pimples\", while deeper nodules (hard swellings) require further treatment. Infllammatory acne may heal with time, but scarring is possible when treatment stops. Treatment should include gentle shampooing of affected areas and using non-abrasive cleaners, avoiding foods that trigger flares, wearing hair off face, and regularly eating a well-balanced diet. Avoid alcohol, processed foods, sugary products, and foods with high iniodine such as salt. The goal is to minimize acne while preventing further flare-ups. Proper cleanzing of affected areas once or twice every day, gentle shampooing with a well-balanced diet, and avoiding abrasive cleansers are some preventive measures that can help.",
